CV runs

First we should have some runs to answer some open questions

1 - Runs for tuning, not to be reported

	- Tuning for image augmentation: we try setting the random brightness and contrast at 0, 0.1 and 0.2
		aug_0.json
		aug_01.json
		aug_02.json
	- Tuning for MTL: try single task learning network as well as all combinations
		stl.json (same as aug_02.json)
		mtl_contour.json
		mtl_distance.json
		mtl_contour_distance.json
	- Tuning for MTL weights: we take the best model from Tuning for MTL and try changing the loss weights. We still do not know what the best model is, so we neet to take the best one from "Tuning for MTL" and change the loss_weights parameter.
		mtl_weights_05.json
		mtl_weights_025.json
		mtl_weights_075.json

Once we run all of these we should have a good idea about what our best model is. We can then start writing the report/running the official cv runs.

2- Runs for reporting results

	- Table 1:
		best_model.json (using the parameters we found in the previous runs)
		table1_no_preprocessing.json
		table1_original_dataset.json
		table1_no_preprocessing_original_dataset.json

	- Table 2:
		best_model.json
		table2_no_pretraining.json
		table2_model_no_se.json
		table2_model_no_mtl.json

	- Table 3:
		Baseline from exercise session 1
		Baseline from exercise session 2
		best_model.json
		best_model_with_postprocessing.json
		ensemble_of_best_models_with_postprocessing.json
